# VR Interactive Game

You're going to build your first game in VR using the A-Frame library and jquery.

## Instructions
Fork and clone this repository or start from scratch. If you're using a fork of this repository, we've already linked A-Frame and Jquery for you.

### Beginner

Create a game of tic tac toe using boxes floating in the air. Give the camera a cursor and apply animations such that when a box is clicked it changes color to blue or red depending on the player's turn

### Intermediate

Use click handlers on individual boxes to keep track of what boxes have been clicked. Store this data in an array and build an algorithm to let the user know when the game is over (and who won).

You can find an example of a working game here: https://twant.github.io/3D-tic-tac-toe/

### Advanced (HARD)

MULTI PLAYER! Use web sockets (socket.io) to have two players meet in the same virtual world to play 3D tic-tac-toe.
